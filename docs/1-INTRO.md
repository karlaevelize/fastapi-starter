# FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

- **Fast:** Very high performance, on par with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Go](https://go.dev/) (thanks to [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)). FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available.

- **Fast to code:** Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%, when compared to other frameworks. This estimation is based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.

- **Fewer bugs:** Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. This estimation is also based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.

- **Intuitive:** Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

- **Easy:** Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

- **Short:** Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.

- **Robust:** Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
